# Reporting Tool

The **Reporting Tool** allows you to collect metrics about the data within your
Stoplight instance. This is done by performing an in-depth analysis of all
project data to aggregate:

- Number of specifications
- Number of endpoints/operation
- Number of models
- Number of validation errors/warnings
- Number of contributors per spec
- Number of versions per spec

And more into a CSV document, which can then be imported into your spreadsheet
application of choice.
