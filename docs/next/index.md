# Stoplight Next

The Stoplight Next platform provides an all-in-one on premises API design, test,
and documentation toolkit, taking the hassle out of your API initiative.

## System Requirements

A minimum of one server is required to run the Stoplight Next application.

### Docker Installations

If running in a container-based environment, the only requirement is a
relatively modern Docker/Moby runtime. Stoplight runs and tests on Docker CE >=
`v17.00`, however most Docker CE/EE versions should also be compatible.

### Native Installations

The following Linux distributions are supported for native installations:

- CentOS / RedHat Enterprise Linux 7 (x86_64) via RPM

## QuickStart Guides

If you are performing a Docker-based deployment of Stoplight Next, please review the
[Docker Quickstart guide](/next/docker-quickstart).

## Getting Help
